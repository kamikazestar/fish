This repository contains my personal [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) configuration.

It uses:
- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) as the plugin manager
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/) as the prompt

## Purpose

This setup is tailored to my workflow and preferences. It's made public for reference and inspiration purposes. Feel free to **fork** and **customize** it for your own needs!

> **Note:** I do not accept contributions to this repository, as it is intended for personal use.

## Installation

If you'd like to use or adapt this configuration:

1. Install Fish shell:  
   [Installation instructions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#installation)

2. Install Fisher:

    ```fish
    curl -sL https://git.io/fisher | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
    ```

3. Clone this repository and link or copy the configuration files into your `$HOME/.config/fish/` directory.

4. Install plugins listed in the `fish_plugins` file:

    ```fish
    fisher update
    ```

5. Install [Starship](https://starship.rs/):

    ```bash
    curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
    ```
6. As an optional step you can use my [Starship configuration](https://github.com/MikePapaSierra/starship).

## Structure

- `config.fish` — main configuration file
- `conf.d/corne-key-bindings.fish` — Corne-oriented interactive keybindings
- `functions/` — custom functions
- `completions/` — completions
- `fish_plugins` — list of Fisher-managed plugins

## Keybindings

The default Fish keybindings remain unchanged. When Fish is interactive, the
following `Alt` bindings provide cross-hand shortcuts on a Corne split
keyboard while also working on a conventional laptop keyboard:

| Action | Binding |
| --- | --- |
| Search command history with fzf | `Alt-r` |
| Search changed files in the current Git repository with fzf | `Alt-g` |

These bindings require the Fisher-managed `fzf.fish` plugin. Fish's native
`Alt-o` current-file preview is deliberately preserved.
