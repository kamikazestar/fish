# fish-config

Fish shell configuration

## Custom configuration

Configuration is using [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)
and [fisk](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/blob/master/docs/Themes.md#fisk) theme.

## Inspiration

My main inspiration to create this configuration was stream one of the AWS developer advocate [Darko Mesaros](https://github.com/darko-mesaros).
Recording from that session can be find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPnYFsXml-I).
